            chapters compiled into 99 tankōbon volumes as of June 2021. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D.
            Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit. With his
            crew of pirates, named the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the world's

            The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who, inspired by his childhood idol and powerful pirate
            "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the titular treasure and proclaim
            himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 1] Luffy
            rescues and befriends a swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the One Piece. They are
            joined in their journey by Nami, a navigator and thief; Usopp, a sniper and a pathological liar; and
            Vinsmoke Sanji, a perverted chef. They acquire a ship named the Going Merry[Jp 2] and engage in
            confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures,
            others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, a doctor and anthropomorphized
            reindeer; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeletal
            musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea.
            Once the Going Merry becomes damaged beyond repair, the Straw Hat Pirates acquire a new ship named the
            Thousand Sunny.[Jp 3] Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations,
            revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and
            foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
